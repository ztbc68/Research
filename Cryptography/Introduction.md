# What is Cryptography?

Cryptography = Crypto + graphy
= secret + writing

Cryptography is the science of using secrets to secure communication betweeen two or more parties over an untrustyed network.

## Security - What does it mean?
- Confidentiality: Only authorized parties learn the content of communication
- Integrity: No unauthorized party can alter the data
- Authentication: Two communicating participants should be able to identify each other
- Non-repudiation: A participant should not be able to deny previous commitments

There are many techniques used to achieve these four goals and these techniques can be evaluated with respect to:
- Level of security
- Functionality
- Performance and Implementation details
